# 2020 New York Taxi Trips Analysis with Python

Welcome to the world of data-driven exploration of New York City's iconic yellow taxis! In this project, we will dive into the vast dataset of 2020 New York taxi trips using Python to gain valuable insights into the city's transportation patterns, peak hours, popular routes, and much more.

The yellow taxis are an integral part of the city's daily life, ferrying millions of passengers across the bustling streets of New York. By harnessing the power of Python and its versatile data analysis libraries, we will uncover hidden patterns and trends buried within this massive dataset.

## Our analysis will be structured as follows:

Data Acquisition: We will start by obtaining the dataset, which contains detailed information about every taxi trip taken throughout 2020. This data will serve as the foundation for our analysis.

Data Preprocessing: Before diving into the analysis, we need to clean and prepare the data. This step involves handling missing values, removing outliers, and converting data into a suitable format for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): This is where the real fun begins! We will use Python's powerful libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize and understand the dataset's characteristics. We will explore key metrics such as trip durations, trip distances, fare amounts, and passenger counts to draw meaningful insights.

Time Series Analysis: As taxi trips exhibit temporal patterns, we will conduct a time series analysis to uncover trends throughout the year. This will help us identify busy periods, seasonality, and any significant changes in taxi usage.

Peak Hour Analysis: Understanding peak hours is crucial for both passengers and taxi drivers. We will analyze the dataset to determine the busiest times of the day, week, and month.

Fare Analysis: We will delve into fare structures and identify factors influencing fare amounts. This analysis can provide valuable insights for passengers and taxi drivers alike.

Conclusion: In the final section, we will summarize our findings and discuss the implications of our analysis. We will also consider potential areas for improvement in the New York taxi system based on the patterns discovered.
